# ft_containers
### [Clic here to see subject]

:warning: this project run on mac(intel) only!

## Project Overview

In this project we had to reimplement from scratch the following C++ STL containers:

1. Vector.
2. Stack.
3. Map.
4. Set.

## What I learned

1. How C++ containers work and how use it.
2. Red Black Tree implementation with template, o(long(n)) complexity 
3. TDD with a preset list of test for each containers (thx mli42)
4. Iterators implementation from scratch.
5. Monitoring of big data structur
6. How to read and understand cpp documentations

## In a nutshell

First big cpp project, in which we had to remake the basic containers.   
This required in-depth research and understanding of their documentation.   
A first approach to a project with a large cpp structure, and significant specifications: 
Re-implementation of iterators, vectors, maps, sets and stacks.    
We also had to research and understand the mechanisms of a redblacktree so that we could reimplement it from scratch to match the performance of the basic functions. 
In addition, the implementation of large-scale repetitive test structures for a project that respects the behavior of the basic containers as closely as possible.
